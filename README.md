### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a data analyst with a passion for finding insights and solutions from data. I have a strong analytical mindset and a keen eye for details. I enjoy applying various data science techniques and tools to solve real-world problems and create value for businesses. I have recently upgraded my skills in  Tableau, SQL, Python, and other data analysis tools to work with different types of data sources, perform data cleaning and manipulation, conduct exploratory and inferential analysis, build predictive models, and visualize data in an effective and engaging way.
Previously worked across various industries with experience at tech start-ups and scale-ups. Keen to pursue a career in a challenging and fast-growing industry with scope to grow and develop.
